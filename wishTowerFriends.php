    The Wish Tower Friends are a group of volunteers, from Eastbourne and further afield, who want to encourage more
    people to visit the Wish Tower and educate them about its historical significance. They took over the running of the
    Tower on a lease from
    Eastbourne Borough Council, with the aims of restoring public access, raising funds to repair the tower, educating
    visitors and to act as a leading community voice in the planning of the new restaurant site, which is currently being
    built.

    Since taking over the lease, the Wish Tower Friends have successfully conducted tours for over 2000 visitors to the
    tower, passing on historical knowledge to inspire the next generation. In addition to this, they have cleaned the
    tower, funded restoration
    projects, both for the building itself and the site, made it easily accessible to the public, and have staged many
    events.
