                The Wish Tower is a well-known and loved landmark on the seafront that can be seen in many paintings and drawings from its earliest era to photography in the present day. The accessibility of the tower means that a wide variety of people can appreciate
                the part that Eastbourne as a whole played in coastal defence over 200 years ago. The Wish Tower is one of 103 gun towers built on the coast of England, and one of 74 other Martello towers built on the south coast between Folkestone and
                Seaford. These towers were numbered, and after multiple numbering changes the towers were numbered from the Folkestone end and the Wish Tower in Eastbourne became Martello Tower Number 73. There were also 29 other towers added later, in
                Suffolk and Essex, but these were given letters instead of numbers. Of the 103 originally built, only 43 remain, yet only two remain in public hands and largely unspoiled - The Dymchurch Tower (owned by English Heritage) and the Wish Tower. The design of the Martello towers was based on one that the Royal Navy encountered at Mortella Point in Corsica years earlier, and the most likely explanation for the name of the towers along the English coast being the Martello towers is a simple mispronounciation of Mortella.

                In the late 18th and Early 19th centuries, the coast from Eastbourne eastwards along Pevensey Bay was heavily defended against potential invasion from continental Europe. In 1794 an incident took place in the French revolutionary wars known as the seige
                of San Fiorenzo. In this incident, the tower at the Mortella point was proving a great defensive manuever for France and while it was inevitably captured by British forces, it held up so well that it inspired the British to build a series
                of towers during the Napoleonic wars - these towers are estimated to have been built between 1805-1810.

                The Wish Tower began construction in early 1806/ late 1807. Construction had finished by 1810, and from 1812-1860 the tower was used as a coastguard station. The tower was decommissioned in 1873 by the War Office as the immediate danger of invasion had passed, and the tower was leased to Eastbourne Borough Council the next year,
                although in 1897 it was sold to the Duke of Devonshire. From 1884-1930 it was used as a geological museum. During the Second World War, a gun battery was installed on the tower. During the 1950s a local campaign to save the tower led to
                it being designated as a protected building and it is Grade II listed. The Wish Tower Cafe was built in 1960 and ten years later the tower was restored and used as a military museum. From 1995-2001 the tower was used as a puppets museum,
                and evidence of this usage can still be seen inside the tower today. From 2001-2013 it was used by the Council as a storeroom. In 2014, it was reopened by the Wish Tower Friends, a group of volunteers who dedicate their time to help the
                conservation effort and provide tours for visitors.
