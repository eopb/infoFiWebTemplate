                    The Wish Tower is a well-known and loved landmark on the seafront that can be seen in many paintings and drawings from its earliest era to photography in the present day. The tower’s accessibility means that a wide variety of people can appreciate the part that Eastbourne as a whole played in coastal defence over 200 years ago.

                <p>
                    In the late 18th and Early 19th centuries, the coast from Eastbourne eastwards along Pevensey Bay was heavily defended against potential invasion from continental Europe. In 1794 an incident took place in the French revolutionary wars known as the seige of San Fiorenzo. In this incident, the tower at the Mortella point was proving a great defensive manuever for France and while it was inevitably captured by British forces, it held up so well that it inspired the British to build a series of towers during the Napoleonic wars - these towers are estimated to have been built between 1805-1810.

                <p>
                    The Wish Tower began construction in early 1806/ late 1807. Construction had finished by 1810. From 1812-1860 the tower was used as a coastguard station. The tower was decommissioned in 1873 and leased to Eastbourne Borough Council the next year. From 1884-1930 it was used as a geological museum. In 1897 it was sold to the Duke of Devonshire. During WW2, a gun battery was installed on the tower. During the 1950s a local campaign to save the tower led to it being designated as a protected building. Wish Tower Café was built in 1960. In 1970, the tower was “restored” and used as a military museum. From 1995-2001 the tower was used as a puppets museum. From 2001-2013 it was used by the Council as a storeroom. In 2014, it was reopened by the Wish Tower Friends.

                    There was a significant military presence including the redoubt fortress and associated barracks, two further smaller fortresses at Langney Point and a chain of 35 Martello towers stretching all along the coast to Hastings. The Wish Tower and the Redoubt Fortress are the only surviving fortifications from this period directly in Eastbourne. There are 26 surviving Martello towers on the South Coast and 10 of these lie within East Sussex.

                    There are several features that play a key significance. The original features include:
                </p>
                <p></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Front door – A substantial, cross-boarded door with strap and pintle hinges gives every appearance of being original</li>
                        <li>Sub-basement cistern – this is in good condition and clearly shows the construction and appears to have waterproof mortar to better hold water in the area. It is also simple to gain safe access to</li>
                        <li>Doorway to the magazine – whilst very damaged, it is clad with the original anti-sparking copper sheet and nails</li>
                        <li>Gun platform level features – many of the original features speak to the use of the traversing gun and offer an easy insight into the intended use of The Tower</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                        The modified features include:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Many features and their contexts have been changed or damaged in the course of The Tower’s use</li>
                        <li>The enlarging of the north-eastern window aperture by the Hollobon family in 1919 was made to improve their museum and lapidary business. The enlargement revealed quite neatly the construction method of the walls</li>
                        <li>The creation of a moat-level intake room to the basement took place during the Tower’s use as a battery during WWII</li>
                        <li>The enlargement of the window between the magazine and the basement storage area was likely a result of the Tower’s use as a battery during WWII</li>
                    </ul>
