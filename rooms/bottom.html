                The Ground Floor, now accessed through the recently added spiral staircase, would have originally been used for storing ammunition and supplies. The magazine room, used to store gunpowder, features "pizza oven" shaped holes, which are vents up to the
                top. This would have provided the ventilation and airflow needed to help keep the gunpowder dry. The original copper covered door remains in place to this day, a safety feature to prevent sparking near gunpowder.

                Evidence of the Tower's use as a puppet museum is seen with the display cabinets on the ground floor and the bright paint on the spiral stairs leading down. Underneath the brick flooring, accessed via two hatchways with wooden covers is a smaller cistern
                area (which is up to 1.2m deep) which would have been used as both a water tank (supplemented by a rainwater collection tank) and storage for food, although this does not continue under the magazine area.
