    The Tower itself is set in the centre of the dry Moat, with entry originally gained via a drawbridge from the Moat
    Wall as an extra defence mechanism. The Moat has been infilled to a depth of approximately 1.5m, which does prevent
    visitors from appreciating
    the full height of the Wish Tower.
</p>
<p>
    Another example of a change following work to the site in 1959/60 includes the revealing of the seaward facing wall,
    with its alternating brick and greensand courses - greensand is a weaker but locally sourced material. The Moat Wall
    itself, although
    not fully intact following work in preparation to demolish the Tower, is in itself a rarity as only 6 other
    remaining south coast towers appear to be in a moat setting, and all of those six appear to be in a worse condition.

    Despite the damaging work during the mid-20th century, which includes the rendered cement on the outside of the
    tower now being in poor condition, more recent work undertaken has greatly improved the site. A Peace Garden has
    recently been built around
    the Wish Tower, thanks to the work of the Eastbourne Civilian War Memorial Trust, to remember those killed and
    injured in the bombing raids on the town during the Second World War. A nine ton piece of glacial granite has been
    placed in
    the moat, on it a steel plaque bearing the names of the 180 civilians who lost their lives.
